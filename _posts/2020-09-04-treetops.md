With life mostly confined indoors these days, long walks have become something of a necessity. And for some reason, walking down Folsom Street with its lovely trees, I just can't help stopping every now and then to gaze upwards at the canopy, and lose myself in the light that shimmers and sparkles from the treetops.

Occasionally, when it seemed overwhelmingly beautiful, I'd attempt to capture it with a photo. Which, while hinting at the beauty, never quite recreated it.

Fortunately, I realised the folly of it soon enough, and now I'm content with simply gazing up in wonder, like our ancestors once did.
