And what better way to ward off work's haunting rigor  
Than to intoxicate myself  
with music I cannot fully recount  
Sung to words 
in a language I do not speak

Verses that wash ashore  
Like waves of foreign lands do, in a million tongues  
And yet, so  
Gurgling with words familiar, sounds akin  
And the echoes of a thousand generations past.  

How many tongues have thy hardy notes sung  
Rippling over your stony syllables,  
Their cragged crevasses -  
fipples to a whistling breath -  
Shaped by the grandchild, smoothened by her own thence  
and so descending,  
as did the peoples from mountain to plain,  
Onto the polished pebbles that find script today.  

And how many fine hill-dwelling hearts  
Have thy passions borne,  
Slurred, whispered, shouted true  
Liberated, unwritten, into time forlorn.  
Some crooned  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of goblets and _gulaab_,  
And others sang -  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of _saans_ and _sharaab_  
And some reminisce  
Of chestnut brown and strands of the sun.  
  
"_Bedeh bedeh_", she says,  
"so I may lose myself" -    
To music our memories recount  
Sung to words  
in a language they speak.
