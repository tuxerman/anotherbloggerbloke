I don't understand. Why, after more than 60 years of having nurtured a national identity, is there such growing insecurity regarding it now?
Languages, festivals, food (of all things). Why did there suddenly appear a need to crystallise everything into a presentable entity?

Is it a subconscious desire to mimic the rest of the connected world? 
Many national identities (despite ethnic diversity) are homogenous. Or is it just another example of the curious phenomenon seen elsewhere in the world? Of a reactive pull back from increasing pluralism? On second thoughts, the latter probably doesn't apply as much much in India as it does in Europe. The economy is still growing, there's not as much exasperation.

Perhaps the less enlightened sorts oiling and being part of the political machinery?
In that case, there has to be a motivation for this. If, on the other hand there's no agenda, what could be the sociological (on a larger scale) and psychological (for the individual) reason behind it?
We could rule out the possibility of it born out of a desperate desire to belong. It's India, almost everyone is happy in the idea that they belong to their little cocoon of clique, clan or caste.
Perhaps then, it's that the smaller mind desires simple narratives and straightforward definitions to feel strong. To feel secure. A simpler view of things at the cost of nuances and subtleties. 

A simple mind unburdened by refinement.
_My contempt is starting to show_

Meanwhile, the 'common man' - the darling of all politicans and the one thing whose existence there was bipartisan recognition of - couldn't care less until these ones in relatively higher positions within power started speaking their mind. The media did a fine job of bandying it about, possibly thus  sowing the seeds of this weird insecurity in people who had not given it much thought so far but were now forced to pick a position.
