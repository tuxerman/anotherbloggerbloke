        <p><p>Night has fallen in the coach. The kid sis has finally relinquished her seat by the window in a matter of minutes after having fought for it for the past half hour, having decided sleeping was a much worthier activity to pursue. She isn’t much of a snorer, but amidst the regular rhythm of the track, another heavy breathing gradually develops into a soft, regular snore. Dad and daughter have turned in for the night and are being gently rocked to sleep by the train.</p>

        <p><p>Growing up in the sleepy city of Trivandrum in the 90s, early school days were prime “Only 90s kids will know” material. This time, I was nine, and fourth standard marked that coming of age in junior school where you transitioned from scruffy Nataraj Gold or Camlin Flora pencils to writing with a pen. Just two years ago, we had been little urchins, our black shorts just shy of our knees struggling to copy down Ms. Murray’s beautiful cursive writing into our four-line notebooks. Silently, almost subconsciously sounding the words we wrote, to ourselves. The silent Rs. (“Goodness, Sriram! Cahtuh, not Kaartar”). Making sure we never stopped to cross our Ts or dot the Is in the midst of a word, but letting the lines flow undisturbed till we completed the word, and then rushing back to complete the little formalities. The grand, flowery tops of the Is and the bottoms of capital Ds. (Many years later - “I love the way you write that D. Here, write my name”.)</p>

        <p><p>Night train journeys have always been special, despite a large portion of my train journeys having been overnight. The earth smells different when you stand at the door facing the dark countryside rushing by outside while the wheels belt out a steady 110kmph rhythm under your feet, and the feeling gets almost surreal. It’s a deeply personal, quiet and contemplative moment I relish  in a life where most of one’s waking hours are spent in a chattering, chaotic and sometimes utterly lunatic world.</p>
